You might have heard many first-time founders of startups trying to first build a solution and then try to find the market suitable for their product, which almost never works out, do they? Just like market research is important in this case, before jumping into how something works, we should gain a deeper understanding of the problem.</p>\n<p>For example, If we take a programming concept like currying, the internet is filled with articles on how to write a currying function in every language possible and multiple implementations too. But unless you get a deeper understanding of why we use currying and understand some real-life scenarios that are tricky to solve without using this concept, what you learned will eventually fade away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"explain-like-im-5-eli5\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#explain-like-im-5-eli5\" aria-label=\"explain like im 5 eli5 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Explain Like I’m 5 (ELI5)</h3>\n<p>Next, before you can dive deep into a topic, spend some time first to understand a simpler abstraction of the problem. I often google a topic name followed by ELI5(short for Explain Like I’m 5) whenever I am studying a new concept. The internet is filled with so many great subreddits and StackOverflow answers which help you get a very atomic understanding of the concept before you can dig deep.</p>\n<p>A while back I decided to brush up my data structure basics and instead of directly jumping into Leetcode problems, I used a coding podcast (BaseCS podcast) as my ELI5. It gave me a much-needed foundation for going deep into the topics later on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"spaced-repetition-with-flash-cards\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#spaced-repetition-with-flash-cards\" aria-label=\"spaced repetition with flash cards permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Spaced repetition with Flash Cards</h3>\n<p>Spaced repetition is an evidence-backed study technique that uses a ‘spacing effect’, to form long-lasting memories. If you’re new to this term, here is how Wikipedia defines it -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spaced repetition is a method where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is\npresented or said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most popular way to practice spaced repetition is with flashcards. There are many systems to use flashcards effectively but my favourite one and the most efficient way of using flashcards is using the Leitner System.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 793px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.33333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/8ac56/flash-cards.webp 240w,\n/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/d3be9/flash-cards.webp 480w,\n/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/51ddc/flash-cards.webp 793w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/09b79/flash-cards.jpg 240w,\n/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/7cc5e/flash-cards.jpg 480w,\n/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/50376/flash-cards.jpg 793w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/ddcf4cd675ad83b475ff5f6476caba5d/50376/flash-cards.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Hero image showing callback hell\"\n            title=\"Hero image showing callback hell\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Here’s how it works - you create 5 boxes where each box corresponds to a time delay after which it shall be revisited. All your flashcards start at box one. After the box’s given time interval elapses, each card you recollect correctly goes to the next box and so on.</p>\n<p>But at any level, if you fail to remember a card, it goes all the way back to box one. That way you spend more time on concepts which are harder to grasp and less time on things you got easily.</p>\n<p>Forgetting your flash-cards even after studying a lot, is very normal and don’t feel bad if that happens to you. In fact some forgetting is necessary to strengthen our learning when revisiting that topic later to form a lasting memory.</p>\n<!-- <figure class=\"float-right\" style=\"width: 240px\">\n\t<img src=\"/media/gutenberg.jpg\" alt=\"Gutenberg\">\n\t<figcaption>Johannes Gutenberg</figcaption>\n</figure> -->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-theme=\"dark\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don&#39;t understand it. <a href=\"https://t.co/s6VVaThO3W\">pic.twitter.com/s6VVaThO3W</a></p>&mdash; Richard Feynman (@ProfFeynman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1063244153960759296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2018</a></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-feynman-technique\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-feynman-technique\" aria-label=\"the feynman technique permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Feynman technique</h3>\n<p>According to the Feynman technique (named after famous physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman), once you’ve studied something, try teaching that to someone who is inexperienced in that topic.</p>\n<p>During the process, you’ll notice the gaps in your learning, go back to learn those.

Our mind often overestimates our thinking and recalling abilities when we read something. Hence we tend to tell ourselves things like “Nah, I get how this example works! No need to write it down, I’ll remember.” Don’t lie to yourself. Take out that notepad and make notes as your study.</p>\n<p>If you’re learning something which involves a paradigm shift like a new framework or language, typing out everything as I learn has proved to be my #1 go-to method these days. It’s really beneficial to write down/type things up as it also helps develop a muscle memory over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selectively-forgetting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#selectively-forgetting\" aria-label=\"selectively forgetting permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Selectively Forgetting</h3>\n<p>With information being available just a Google search away these days do we really need to remember everything?

As long as you can remember the topic briefly and remember that it is available on Google, we’re good.</p>\n<p>There are things I almost always lookup like browser APIs, the difference between slice and splice or regex patterns to name a few and feel we don’t need to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrDAuU8Blhc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bradly Cooper from Limitless</a> and try to remember everything.
