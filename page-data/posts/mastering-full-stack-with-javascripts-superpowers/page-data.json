Although I was making some good side cash and had a bunch of happy clients, the code I was writing was not great as it seemed tough to expertise on every aspect of web development at the same time.</p>\n<p>Being a hardcore JS fan and ardent lover of interfaces, I decided to focus solely on frontend and after freelancing for a few more months, I join a startup as a frontend developer. I was content with my learnings and adventures in the frontend land… until I came across this yesterday ~</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The roles required to design and develop a web solution require a deep\nskill set and vast experience in the area of visual design, UI/interaction design, <a href=\"https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-front-end-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">front-end development</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#-back-end-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">back-end development</a>.\nAny person who can fill one or more of these 4 roles at a professional\nlevel is an extremely rare commodity.</p>\n<p>However, given that JavaScript has infiltrated all layers of a\ntechnology stack (e.g. React, node.js, express, couchDB, gulp.js\netc…) finding a full-stack JS developer who can code the front-end\nand back-end is becoming less mythical. -<a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/practice/myth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Frontend Handbook\n‘18</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I started wondering, why not? I already know frontend, I also manage to write some (crappy but) working backend code in php for my side projects, why not harness my javascript knowledge and become a full stack javascript developer, just by connecting the dots and a bit of learning?</p>\n<p>When it comes to learning, the reason majority of our plans fail is because <strong><em>we don’t often have an action plan</em></strong>. And any resolution or goal without a proper plan is bound to fail! So I started there, with the planning.\n[fun fact: that’s the same reason why our new year resolution’s fail!]</p>\n<p>I spent the next day researching on topics and resources one needs to learn in course of this journey to be a full stack developer just by harnessing the superpowers of Javascript. So I created a to-do list which starts at the very basics of javascript and build its way up to the more advance concepts, covering all the tech stacks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YgBfkWW.png\" alt=\"Screenshot from notes app\"></p>\n<p>If you’re a front-end developer looking forward to <em>up your game</em> or maybe you’re already a full-stack developer and want to brush up your skills for an interview or for your next side project, I’m certain, this will be helpful to you.</p>\n<p>I posted the list on Github which you can <a href=\"https://github.com/siwalikm/Prep-for-Full-Stack-JS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">check it out here</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to stay motivated and track your progress, fork my todo list from Github and commit to your repo with crossed out items, as you progress.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/siwalikm/Prep-for-Full-Stack-JS.git</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>P.S. Remember: The key is to stay motivated.</strong></p>\n<p>If possible, start learning along with a friend and maybe build something together along the process. If you’re learning alone, reach out to people if you get stuck and try to document your learnings.</p>\n<p>Share this post with your friends if you think they’ll find it helpful.
